NAME
    nscheck - tool to examine .ns file for certain kinds of corruption

SYNOPSIS
    python nscheck.py [--detail] [--repair] file_or_directory ...

DESCRIPTION

    The nscheck tool checks for namespace (.ns) file corruption
    detailed at [1]. Please read the information at that page before
    using this tool.

    Each file listed on the command line is checked for errors. If a
    directory is specified it is recursively traversed to find .ns
    files to check. For example,

        python nscheck.py $dbpath

    will check all .ns files in $dbpath.

    By default, for each file a line is printed indicating either that
    it is OK, or if not listing the number of errors found.

    The error check can be run on a live system, with a very small
    chance of a temporary false ERROR report if a namespace (db,
    collection, index) is being added while nscheck is running. Run it
    a second time to screen out false positives.

    The repair procedure *must* be run with mongod shut down.

    --detail

        With this option a line is printed for each non-empty entry in
        the .ns file.  For valid entries the namespace name is
        printed. For invalid entries "ERROR" is displayed.

    --repair

        Repairs invalid entries by zeroing them. Use this option with
        caution.  To use this mongod *must not* be running. Take
        backups first. See additional information at [1] and contact
        me (Bruce Lucas) first if possible before using.
