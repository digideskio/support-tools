NAME
    nscheck - tool to repair certain .ns file corruption

SYNOPSIS
    python nscheck.py [--repair] file_or_directory ...

DESCRIPTION

    The nscheck tool checks for namespace (.ns) file corruption
    detailed at [1]. Please read the information at that page before
    using this tool.

    Each file listed on the command line is checked for errors. If a
    directory is specified it is recursively traversed to find .ns
    files to check. For example,

        python nscheck.py $dbpath

    will check all .ns files in $dbpath.

    A line is printed for each non-empty entry in the .ns file,
    showing the namespace name for that entry and a message indicating
    the status of the entry.

    The repair procedure *must* be run with mongod shut down.

    --repair

        Repairs each nsfile the file as follows:

          * create a new file with the name $nsfile.repaired and
            initialize it to zeroes

          * copy all good entries from $nsfile to $nsfile.repaired.

          * rename $nsfile to $nsfile.backup and rename
            $nsfile.repaired to $nsfile.
