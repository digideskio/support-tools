NAME
    dups.py - tool for detecting duplicate blocks in a file

SYNPOSIS
    python dups.py filename blocksize

DESCRIPTION

    This tool aids in detecting a particular kind of database file
    corruption consisting of incorrectly duplicated block(s). It was
    created to scan database files for additional instances of a
    particular kind of corruption that we have seen with one customer
    (in two separate files) consisting of a duplicated 4KB page
    (i.e. 4KB on a 4KB boundary).  See HELP-220 and SUPPORT-681 for
    details.

    With the particular db files examined in SUPPORT-681:

    * With a block size of 4096, which was the observed corrupted
      block size, it reported only the block that was known to be
      corrupted using other tools (mongodump --validate and mdb).

    * With a block size of 1024 it reported a few false positives
      consisting of a couple of non-zero bytes at the beginning of the
      block followed by all 0s. The program reports the number of
      non-zero bytes so we can filter out these false positives
      manually.

    * With a block size of 512 it produced a lot of false
      positives. That particular customer's data seems to have a lot
      of repetition; unknown how common that is.

    It shouldn't be necessary to stop mongod to get a guaranteed
    consistent file view before scanning the file because we are
    looking for corruption that happened sometime in the past and
    is therefore static.

    It should be safe to run against production data, but out of an
    abundance of caution we might suggest the customer copy the data
    off to another location, and maybe another server, before running
    the program.

    The program could be run against all db files, or you could
    identify the db file with corruption by using validate and only
    scan the corrupted file.

    Blocks consisting of all 0s are ignored.
