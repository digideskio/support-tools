Data-Sets for testing MongoDB
===

Folder with datasets for issue/feature reproduction purposes.

Objectives:
---

### Have easy to test data-sets for reproducing various scenarios


These could be query performance related, IO performance related.

These can be also scripts that generate data.

All scripts or data-sets must have a clear and short description.

Optional but recommended, include the reason why that specific data-set was needed and what test, queries or benchmarks you carry out.

Few rules:
---

- Don't upload any kind of Customer Data
- Be explicit when describing the dataset or script.
- Think about the Audience: SAs, CEs, Support, etc
