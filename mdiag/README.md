mdiag
=====

Script to give to users/customers, to gather a wide variety of system-level diagnostic information.

To deploy this to a customer/user on a case, give them the [mdiag.sh](./mdiag.sh) script (eg. attach
it to the Jira ticket), and have them run it with the command-line:

    sudo bash mdiag.sh CS-12345

(substituting an appropriate ticket number/id).
