NAME
    mdb-wt - simple tool to dump parts of mongo+wt databases

SYNOPSIS
    python mdb-wt.py -p[e[bB]] file [offset]

DESCRIPTION

    mdb-wt prints a low-level dump of MongoDB databases using the
    WiredTiger storage engine.
    
    Operation is controlled by a set of flags specified in the first
    argument, as follows:

    p Print the pages of the spedified file if no offset is
      specified. If an offset is specified print only that page.

    e When used with the p flag, page entries are printed.

    b When used with the e flag, BSON values (for collection files)
      and BSON keys (for index files) are printed.

    B Like the b flag, except that field values for all types is
      printed.

INSTALLING SNAPPY

    To examine page contents (keys and values) for pages compressed
    using Snappy you will need the snappy library and Python snappy
    module. To install:

    On Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo apt-get install python-dev
    sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev
    sudo pip install python-snappy

    On EL:
    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo yum install snappy-devel
    sudo yum install gcc-c++
    sudo pip install python-snappy

    Snappy support is not needed to view page headers and block
    manager pages as these are not compressed.
